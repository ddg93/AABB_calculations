# Axes-Aligned Bounding Boxes calculations
This repository contains python scripts used to calculate the Axes-Aligned Bounding Boxes of spheroidal and cylindrical objects with an imposed orientation.
To use, just set the particle radius and particle aspect ratio (i.e., the ration between the particle length (along the first direction) and the particle diameter (of the objection section laying in the plane perpendicular to that first direction)).
Also, you may want to specify the number of considered particle orientations.
